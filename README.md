# FakeHDHR_Locast


Welcome to the world of streaming to Plex! We use some fancy python here to achieve a system of:

**H**ome
**D**istribution
**H**iatus
**R**ecreation


(based off of original code from

  * [tvhProxy by jkaberg](https://github.com/jkaberg/tvhProxy)
  * [locast2plex by tgorgdotcom](https://github.com/tgorgdotcom/locast2plex)
  * myself coding for locast2plex

  )

Until I have time to do the wiki thing for this project, instructions will be in this `README.md`.

PRs welcome for:

* Docker support
