Welcome to the world of streaming content as a DVR device! We use some fancy python here to achieve a system of:

**f**un
**H**ome
**D**istribution
**H**iatus
**R**ecreation


Please Check the [Docs](docs/README.md) for Installation information.

fHDHR is labeled as beta until we reach v1.0.0

Join us in `#fHDHR <irc://irc.freenode.net/#fHDHR>`_ on Freenode.

If you enjoy the code, consider buying me a Coke!

## Docker Support
I am not a docker user, but I am fairly certain that after you assemble the plugins you want in the plugins folder, and run the Dockerfile, it should still work*.
