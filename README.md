Welcome to the world of streaming content as a DVR device! We use some fancy python here to achieve a system of:

**f**un
**H**ome
**D**istribution
**H**iatus
**R**ecreation

fHDHR is labeled as beta until we reach v1.0.0

Join us in `#fHDHR <irc://irc.freenode.net/#fHDHR>`_ on Freenode.

Support for the stand-alone eth4 and eth6 versions of Ceton devices is confirmed.
The PCI devices might work, but due to a lack of hardware, have not been tested.

Unlike the other origin plugins, this one requires the fHDHR_plugin_stream_ffmpeg.
